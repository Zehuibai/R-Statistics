# Deep Learning

Deep learning builds on knowledge of statistics, data science, and machine learning to define models loosely inspired by biological nervous systems. Deep learning models evolved from neural network models after the vanishing-gradient problem was resolved by training one layer at a time, and have proven useful in image and speech recognition tasks. 

> 深度学习建立在统计学，数据科学和机器学习的知识之上，以定义受生物神经系统松散启发的模型。消失梯度问题通过一次训练一层来解决之后，深度学习模型便从神经网络模型演变而来，并已证明在图像和语音识别任务中很有用。
